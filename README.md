# dbskit

It is a easy database toolkit between mongo and mysql. No matter which you choose, you should follow syntax of mongo. Yes mysql part of dbskit will transfer syntax of mongo to mysql when necessary, although it is not equivalent, you can implement the hook in limited scenarios.

Maybe you have other choice to cross platform, like sqlalchemy, but dbskit is easy to use and control.
